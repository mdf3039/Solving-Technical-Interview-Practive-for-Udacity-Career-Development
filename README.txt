This is the README of the Technical Interview Practice for Udacity's Career Development. There are five questions. Each question will be listed along with a text explanation of the efficiency of the code and design choice
*Python 2.7 is needed to run all code.

Question 1: Given two strings s and t, determine whether some anagram of t is a substring of s. For example: if s = "udacity" and t = "ad", then the function returns True. Your function definition should look like: question1(s, t) and return a boolean True or False.
Answer: This was written in one line of code, so the code is really efficient. I used an if else statement.
No additional libraries were used.
